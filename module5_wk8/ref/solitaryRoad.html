<p><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Electrical oscillations in an L-C circuit. </span></span>A circuit containing only a switch, charged
capacitor, and inductor will exhibit oscillator behavior when the switch on the circuit is closed
due to a mechanism of repeating discharge and recharge of the capacitor.  Fig. 1 (a) shows a
circuit containing a charged capacitor
C, an inductor L of negligible
resistance, and a switch S.  We now
consider the oscillatory behavior that
occurs when the capacitor discharges
on the closure of the switch:  At the
instant the switch is closed, the
capacitor starts discharging through
the inductor.  As it discharges, a
magnetic field builds up in the
inductor and the stored-up energy of
the capacitor is transferred to the
inductor.  When it has completely
discharged, the potential difference
between its terminals has decreased
to zero.  See Fig. 13 (b). The magnetic field of the inductor now starts decreasing, inducing an
emf in the inductor in the same direction as the current. The current consequently persists, but
with diminishing magnitude, until the magnetic field has disappeared and the capacitor has been
charged in the opposite sense to its original polarity, as shown in Fig. 1 (c).  The process now
repeats itself in the opposite direction and in the absence of energy losses the charges on the
capacitor will surge back and forth indefinitely.</p>
<br>
<p>Thus the charge flows back and forth between the plates of the capacitor, through the inductor.
The energy oscillates back and forth between the capacitor and the inductor until (if not
replenished by power from an external circuit) internal resistance causes the oscillations to die
out in a process called damping. The action of the circuit is similar to that of a pendulum
swinging back and forth, or water sloshing back and forth in a tank. It is for this reason that the
circuit is sometimes called a <span style="font-weight: bold">tank circuit</span>. The oscillation frequency is determined by the
capacitance and inductance values. In typical tuned circuits in electronic equipment the
oscillations are very fast, thousands to millions of times per second.</p>
<br>
<p>The frequency of the electrical oscillations is given by</p>

</p>
<br>
<p>This frequency is called the natural frequency of the L-C
circuit.</p>
<br>
<p>The L-C circuit is an example of what is called a
<span style="font-weight: bold">harmonic oscillator </span>i.e. a vibratory system exhibiting
simple harmonic motion.   </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Rectifiers.</span></span>  A rectifier is an electrical device that allows
current to flow in one direction but not in the other.  They
include vacuum tube diodes, mercury-arc valves,
ignitrons, copper and selenium oxide rectifiers,
semiconductor diodes, silicon-controlled rectifiers and
other silicon-based semiconductor switches. </p>

<p>Fig. 2(a) shows a circuit commonly used to perform a
half-wave rectification where T is a transformer and D is a
diode.  The input wave is shown in Fig. 2(b) and the output
wave that appears in load L is shown in Fig. 2(c).  </p>
<br>
<p>Fig. 3(a) shows a circuit that performs a full-wave rectification
that employs a center tap transformer T and two diodes with
the output wave that appears in load L shown in Fig. 3(c).  <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Smoothing the pulsating DC from an AC rectifier.
</span></span>Many applications require a steady DC current such as is
produced by a battery. A capacitor called a <span style="font-weight: bold">reservoir
capacitor </span>is used to smooth the pulsating output from a
rectifier.  The circuit of Fig. 4(a) illustrates the use of a
reservoir capacitor to smooth the output of the diode rectifier. 
The input is AC current, the diode rectifies it, and the
capacitor smooths it.  As the rectifier voltage increases, it
charges the capacitor and also supplies current to the load. At
the end of the quarter cycle, the capacitor is charged to its
peak value. After this, the rectifier voltage starts to decrease
and this initiates the discharge of the capacitor through the
load. </p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Electromagnetic
radiation.</span></span>  What is
electromagnetic radiation? 
How is it produced? Consider
this:  First, we know that an
electric charge (positive or
negative) has an electric field
around it that extends
indefinitely out into space. 
Second, we know that if the
charge moves, it then also has a
magnetic field around it that
extends indefinitely out into
space. Thus a moving charge
has both a electric and magnetic
field around it.  Now suppose
the charge vibrates to-and-fro in
a simple harmonic type of
motion.  What happens?  As it
vibrates, its electric field
vibrates with it in harmonic
fashion.  In addition, because of its constantly changing velocity, its magnetic field, whose
strength depends on velocity, also changes in harmonic fashion.  It thus generates two
harmonically oscillating fields — one a harmonically oscillating electric field and the other a
harmonically oscillating magnetic field — both propagating out into space in much the same way
as sound propagates out into space from a sound
source.  These two harmonically oscillating fields
propagating out into space constitute electromagnetic
radiation.</p>
<br>
<p>A picture of the electric field and magnetic field
components of an electromagnetic wave is shown in
Fig. 5.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Electromagnetic spectrum.</span></span> The
electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible
frequencies of electromagnetic radiation.  Fig. 5

<p>Examination of the
electromagnetic
spectrum in Fig. 6
shows a number of
different types of
waves:  radio
waves,
microwaves, infra-red waves, light
waves, X-rays,
Gamma rays, etc.  </p>
<br>
<p>Light waves are
usually generated
by substances
heated to
incandescence, X-rays are produced
by directing a
stream of high
energy electrons
against a metal
plate inside a
vacuum tube,
Gamma rays are
produced in the
decay of radium
and other
radioactive
substances.  How
are radio waves
produced?  Radio
waves are
produced by
rapidly vibrating
charge in an
antenna, or more
precisely, a high
frequency
alternating current
moving back and
forth in an
antenna.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Antennas and broadcasting.</span></span>  The most common type
of antenna is the <span style="font-weight: bold">half-wave dipole antenna </span>shown in Fig. 7
(a).  It is a conductor with two arms of equal length with
each 
</p><div class="WPParaBoxWrapper" style="width: 202px; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaBox" style="border: none">

<p></p>
<p>arm equal to one quarter of the wavelength being
transmitted.  Each arm is connected to an output terminal of
a radio frequency (r.f.) generator. See Fig. 7 (b). For an
antenna to operate properly, it must be of such length that
standing waves will be formed that flow back and forth
between the ends of the antenna. Most of the energy is
reflected at the ends but some is radiated out into space, a
phenomenon  analogous to the behavior of standing sound
waves in an organ pipe with most being reflected, but some
radiated.  In broadcasting, the antennas are usually oriented
in a vertical position.  The electromagnetic field generated
by a vertically oriented half-wave dipole antenna is shown
in Fig. 8.  Along the x and z axes the electric and magnetic
fields follow the form of Fig. 5 above. </p>
<br>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 14pt">Piezoelectric effect.</span></span>  When certain
substances (crystals, such as Rochelle salt
and quartz; certain ceramics; and
biological material such as bone) are
subjected to a mechanical stress (as in
distorting, twisting, compressing, etc.) the
opposite surfaces become electrically
charged, the potential difference
generated between the sides being
proportional to the amount of stress
applied. If the two sides are connected by
a wire, current will flow. This is known as
the Piezoelectric effect. The crystal with
its supporting apparatus is called a
piezoelectric cell.  </p>
<br>
<p>Crystal microphones use the piezoelectric
effect to transform the varying pressure of
sound waves into an electric current that
varies as the pressure of the sound wave.</p>
<br>
<p>The piezoelectric effect also works in
reverse: the crystal experiences a
mechanical strain when subjected to a
difference in electrical potential.  An alternating voltage placed across the crystal will cause a
mechanical vibration proportional to the varying voltage.</p>
<br>
<p>Crystal headphones use this reverse piezoelectric effect to transform varying voltages into
mechanical vibrations.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Microphones.</span></span>  Microphones change sound waves into the electrical equivalent of sound — 
which is an alternating current known as the <span style="font-weight: bold">audio signal</span>.  There are a number of ways this can
be done and so there are microphones that work through different principles.  The <span style="font-weight: bold">crystal
microphone </span>utilizes the piezoelectric effect.  The <span style="font-weight: bold">carbon microphone </span>works on fact that when
carbon granules are compressed to a greater or lesser degree by a diaphragm, their resistance
varies with the acoustic pressure, thus producing corresponding fluctuations in current.  In the
<span style="font-weight: bold">condenser microphone</span> the diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and the vibrations
produce changes in the distances between the plates, causing the capacitor capacity to vary.  In
the <span style="font-weight: bold">moving coil microphone </span>a small movable induction coil, positioned in the magnetic field of
a permanent magnet, is attached to the diaphragm. When the diaphragm vibrates, the coil moves
in the magnetic field producing a varying current in the coil through electromagnetic induction. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="WPParaBoxWrapper" style="width: 275px; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaBox" style="border: none">

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Speakers and headphones.</span></span> Speakers and most headphones operate the same way.  The
difference is size.  Fig. 9 shows a diagram of a
dynamic loudspeaker. Its construction is the same
as that of the moving coil microphone just
described. A small coil attached to the cone-shaped diaphragm of the speaker vibrates inside
either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet
that is energized with direct current. When current
flows in the small coil (called the voice coil), it
becomes a variable electromagnet interacting with
the larger magnet.  When the current in the voice
coil changes direction, its polar orientation
reverses. This changes the magnetic forces
between the voice coil and larger magnet, moving
the coil and attached diaphragm back and forth. 
When the coil moves, it pushes and pulls on the
speaker cone. This vibrates the air in front of the
speaker, creating sound waves. The frequency and
amplitude of the audio signal dictates the rate and
distance that the voice coil moves. This, in turn,
determines the frequency and amplitude of the
sound waves produced by the diaphragm.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">AM and FM broadcasting.  </span></span>The frequency range of audible sound is 20 - 20,000 cycles per
second.  Consequently, the frequency range of the electrical audio signal that is output by a
microphone is 20 - 20,000 cycles per second.  Now 20,000 cycles per second corresponds to a
wavelength of 15,000 m (λ = c/f = 3∙10<sup>8</sup> / 2∙10<sup>4</sup> = 15,000).  Broadcasting radiation of this
wavelength would require a dipole antenna that was 7,500 meters long which is not practical.  In

</p><div class="WPParaBoxWrapper" style="width: 238px; float: right; clear: right"><span class="WPParaBox" style="border: none">
<img src="./solitaryRoad_files/ole10.gif" alt="ole10.gif" width="238" height="451" border="0"></span></div>
<p></p>
<p>addition, an antenna will broadcast a signal of a particular wavelength, not a band of
wavelengths.  Thus we cannot just feed the audio signal
into an antenna and broadcast it. So how does one
broadcast the audio signal?  The answer to this problem
was found in superimposing the audio signal on top of a
high frequency signal (called the carrier wave, or carrier
signal) that one can broadcast.  The audio signal thus
rides on the carrier signal and is then extracted from the
carrier signal at the receiving end by the circuitry in the
radio.  </p>
<br>
<p>There are two methods of putting the audio signal on
the carrier wave.  One method is called <span style="font-weight: bold">amplitude
modulation </span>(AM) and the other method is called
<span style="font-weight: bold">frequency modulation</span> (FM).  </p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Amplitude modulation. </span>In amplitude modulation,
when the audio signal is placed on the carrier signal, the
amplitude of the carrier signal is changed but its
frequency remains unchanged.  Fig. 10 (a) shows an
unmodulated carrier signal, Fig. 10 (b) shows an audio
signal, and Fig. 10 (c) shows the amplitude modulated
carrier signal.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Frequency modulation.</span> In frequency modulation,
when the audio signal is placed on the carrier signal, the
amplitude of the carrier signal is unchanged but its
frequency varies in accordance with the changes in the amplitude of the audio signal.  10 (c)
shows the frequency modulated carrier signal for the carrier signal of Fig. 10 (a) and the audio
signal of Fig. 10 (b).</p>
<br>
<p>The standard AM broadcasting band extends from 540 kHz to 1,600 kHz.  The FM band extends
from 88 MHz to 108 MHz. </p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The making and broadcasting of a radio program.</span>  Let us consider the steps involved in the
making and broadcasting of a radio program.  The program is recorded with a microphone in a
studio.  See Fig. 11.  The audio signals from the microphone are weak and need to be amplified
thousands of times before they can be transmitted via wire to the transmitter building.  This
amplification is done in the control room next to the studio with an audio amplifier.   The
strengthened audio signal is then transmitted by wire to the transmitter building. At the
transmitter building the audio signal is amplified some more and then combined with the carrier
signal.  The frequency of the carrier signal is one that has been assigned to the station by Federal
Communications Commission.  The modulated signal is then sent to the transmitting tower
where it is broadcast.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: bold">Radio wave propagation.</span></span> Part of the radio wave
propagated out from the transmission antenna travels
parallel to the ground.  This part of the wave is called
the <span style="font-weight: bold">ground wave</span>.   The other part of the wave travels
upward toward the sky and is called the <span style="font-weight: bold">sky wave</span>.  </p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The ground wave.</span> The ground wave gets weaker, the
further one gets from the station.  The higher the
power of the station, the further away its signal can be
picked up.  However, 50 miles is about the limit for
good reception for an AM station.  </p>
<br>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">The sky wave. </span> In the daytime most AM sky waves
keep going on up into space as shown by the route
from A to B in Fig. 12. However at night, AM sky
waves, under the right conditions, may get bent and
reflected back down to earth by an ionized layer of
particles ( the ionosphere) somewhere between 50 and
200 miles up as shown in Fig. 12. The waves may then
be reflected back up to the sky and then reflected down
again. A wave may be reflected between earth and sky
in this way several times before its energy dies out,
allowing the wave to travel halfway around the earth
or further.  Consequently, the reception of a particular
station will be good in those areas where the wave is
hitting the earth, but poor in between these points. The
distance between the points of good reception is called the <span style="font-weight: bold">skip distance</span>. Since the ionospheric
layers move up
and down from
hour to hour, the
skip distance also
changes from
hour to hour.</p>
<br>
<p>FM sky waves,
being of much
higher frequency,
are rarely
reflected by the
ionosphere, but
instead pass
through it out
into space.</p>
